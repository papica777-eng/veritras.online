## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using QANTUM:

1. **Keep your license key secret** - Never commit it to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run `npm audit` regularly
4. **Use the latest version** of QANTUM

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Use environment variables
const mm = new QAntum({
  licenseKey: process.env.MISTER_MIND_LICENSE
});

// ❌ Bad - Hardcoded license
const mm = new QAntum({
  licenseKey: 'MM-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX'
});
```

## 🔐 License Key Security

- License keys are validated server-side
- Keys are hashed and never stored in plain text
- Each key is tied to a specific email/account
- Keys can be revoked if compromised

Thank you for helping keep QANTUM secure! 🙏
