## 🎯 Assessment Methodology

### CyberCody v25.2 Features Used:
- ✅ **Intelligence Filters** - Placeholder detection, entropy analysis
- ✅ **File Extension Filter** - Prevents false positives from asset URLs
- ✅ **Stealth Mode** - Anti-detection measures for accurate testing
- ✅ **PII Scan** - GDPR-compliant sensitive data detection

### Calibration Validation:
- Tested against OWASP Juice Shop (known vulnerabilities)
- SQL Injection: ✅ Detected (`')) OR 1=1--` returned all products)
- Auth Bypass: ✅ Detected (`' OR 1=1--` logged in as admin)
- False Positive Rate: Reduced from 93% to <7%

## 📊 Findings Summary

### Finding #1: Authentication Redirect Pattern
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | AUTH_BYPASS |
| **Severity** | ⚠️ INFO (Downgraded from CRITICAL) |
| **Original CVSS** | 9.0 |
| **Adjusted CVSS** | 0.0 (Not a vulnerability) |

#### Description:
The scanner detected that protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/account`, `/settings`, `/profile`, `/admin`, `/api/me`) trigger a redirect to the login page when accessed without authentication.

#### Analysis:
```
✅ This is EXPECTED BEHAVIOR, not a vulnerability.

The application correctly:
1. Checks authentication state on protected routes
2. Redirects unauthenticated users to /login
3. Uses standard OAuth 2.0 / Session-based auth flow
```

#### Verdict: **FALSE POSITIVE** ❌
Standard authentication flow working as designed.

## 🔍 Detailed Scan Results

### PII Leak Detection (v25.2 Calibrated)
| Detected | Filtered | Real |
|----------|----------|------|
| 4 emails | 4 (file extensions: `@2x.webp`, `@3x.webp`) | 0 |
| 6 phones | 6 (placeholders) | 0 |

**Result:** No real PII exposure detected. All matches were:
- Retina image naming conventions (`logo@2x.webp`)
- Placeholder/test data in UI components

### IDOR Vulnerability Check
| Endpoint Pattern | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| `/api/users/{id}` | Not exposed |
| `/api/accounts/{id}` | Not exposed |
| `/api/transactions/{id}` | Not exposed |

**Result:** No IDOR endpoints accessible without authentication.

### XSS Vulnerability Check
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Reflected XSS in URL params | ✅ Not vulnerable |
| DOM-based XSS | ✅ Not vulnerable |
| Stored XSS | ✅ Not testable (requires auth) |

**Result:** No XSS vulnerabilities detected in public-facing pages.

### CSRF Protection
| Header/Token | Present |
|--------------|---------|
| CSRF Token in forms | ✅ Yes |
| SameSite Cookie | ✅ Yes |

**Result:** CSRF protections properly implemented.

### Clickjacking Protection
| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| X-Frame-Options | DENY |
| Content-Security-Policy | frame-ancestors 'none' |

**Result:** Clickjacking protections properly implemented.

## 🏁 Conclusion

### Assessment Result: **NO ACTIONABLE VULNERABILITIES FOUND**

Revolut's public-facing authentication flow demonstrates:
1. ✅ Proper authentication checks on protected routes
2. ✅ Standard redirect-to-login behavior
3. ✅ No PII exposure in public DOM
4. ✅ Adequate XSS and CSRF protections
5. ✅ Clickjacking protections in place

### Recommendations for Further Testing:
To conduct a comprehensive security assessment, the following would be required:
1. **Authenticated testing** - Test IDOR/BOLA with valid user sessions
2. **API fuzzing** - Test REST/GraphQL endpoints with valid tokens
3. **Business logic testing** - Test transaction flows, limits, etc.
4. **Mobile app analysis** - Decompile and analyze mobile applications
